# Shadow Kingdom

A dynamic, AI-powered text adventure game built with Node.js, TypeScript, and Grok AI featuring region-based world generation.

## Overview

Shadow Kingdom is an interactive text-based adventure game that uses AI to generate rich, atmospheric rooms and connections within thematically coherent regions. Players explore a mysterious fantasy kingdom where each area tells a cohesive story through connected spaces, from grand manor estates to ancient crypts and mystical gardens.

## Features

- **🏰 Region-Based World Generation**: Thematically coherent areas (mansions, forests, caves, towns) with distance-based transitions
- **🤖 AI-Generated Content**: Rooms, descriptions, and connections dynamically created by Grok AI with regional context
- **⚡ Background Generation**: World expands automatically as you explore - new rooms generate in real-time
- **🧭 Dual Navigation System**: Navigate using cardinal directions ("north") or atmospheric descriptions ("through the crystal archway")
- **💾 Persistent Worlds**: Save and load multiple game sessions with SQLite database
- **📍 Region Discovery**: Explore region centers containing important content and NPCs
- **🎯 Session Interface**: Programmatic command execution for automation and testing
- **🔍 Debug Commands**: Inspect region statistics and world structure
- **🏛️ Visit-to-Lock System**: Rooms maintain consistent layout after first visit

### Example Gameplay

```
> look

Grand Entrance Hall
===================
You stand in a magnificent entrance hall that speaks of forgotten grandeur. 
Towering marble columns stretch up to a vaulted ceiling painted with faded 
celestial murals...

Exits: through the ornate archway beneath celestial murals (north), 
through the glass doors that shimmer with moonlight (east), 
up the stone steps to the winding tower (west)

> region

Current Region: Shadow Kingdom Manor
Type: mansion
Description: A grand manor estate shrouded in mystery, filled with elegant 
halls, ancient libraries, and moonlit gardens where forgotten secrets await discovery.
Distance from center: 0
Total rooms in region: 6
Center room: Grand Entrance Hall

> go through the glass doors
> north
> through ornate archway
```

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **GameController** (`src/gameController.ts`): Main game logic and command processing
- **RegionService** (`src/services/regionService.ts`): Region-based world generation and management
- **GrokClient** (`src/ai/grokClient.ts`): AI integration for content generation
- **SessionInterface** (`src/sessionInterface.ts`): Programmatic command execution
- **Database** (`src/utils/database.ts`): SQLite database wrapper
- **CLI Interface**: Interactive command-line interface with readline

### Data Model

The game uses a comprehensive SQLite database schema:

#### Core Tables
- **`games`**: Game sessions with metadata and timestamps
- **`rooms`**: Generated rooms with descriptions, processing state, and region assignments
- **`connections`**: Bidirectional room links with both cardinal directions and thematic names
- **`game_state`**: Current player position and session state

#### Region System
- **`regions`**: Complete thematic areas with pre-generated rooms, guardians, and progression
- **`region_plans`**: AI-generated region concepts and room templates for queue system
- **`region_room_templates`**: Individual room designs within each region plan
- **`guardian_states`**: Track guardian combat state and key acquisition per region

#### Key Relationships
```sql
-- Region queue system for proactive generation
region_plans.game_id → games.id
region_room_templates.region_plan_id → region_plans.id

-- Rooms belong to instantiated regions
rooms.region_id → regions.id
regions.plan_id → region_plans.id

-- Connections link rooms with dual addressing
connections.from_room_id → rooms.id
connections.to_room_id → rooms.id
connections.direction → cardinal direction (north, south, etc.)
connections.name → thematic description (through crystal archway)

-- Guardian system tracks region progression
guardian_states.region_id → regions.id
guardian_states.game_id → games.id
```

### AI Integration

The game uses Grok AI to generate:
- **Complete Regions**: Two-phase generation of region concepts and individual room designs
- **Guardian System**: AI creates thematic guardians, keys, and locked exits for progression
- **Region Concepts**: High-level themes, atmospheres, and narrative elements for coherent areas
- **Contextual Rooms**: Individual room generation using region concept as context
- **Thematic Connections**: Atmospheric connection names that enhance immersion
- **Fallback Systems**: Graceful degradation when AI generation fails

## Development

### Key Features Implementation

#### Region-Based Generation
- **Region Queue System**: Proactive complete region generation with 12 pre-connected rooms
- **Region Types**: mansion, forest, cave, town with specialized AI prompts and guardian system
- **Complete Region Design**: Each region has guardian, key, and locked exit progression
- **Thematic Coherence**: All rooms within region maintain consistent atmosphere and narrative flow

#### Dual Navigation System
- **Cardinal Directions**: Traditional north/south/east/west movement
- **Thematic Names**: "through the crystal archway", "up the starlit steps to the garden"
- **Case-Insensitive Matching**: Natural language input processing
- **AI-Generated Names**: Contextual connection descriptions that enhance immersion

#### Visit-to-Lock System
- **Layout Consistency**: Rooms lock their connection layout when first visited
- **Phantom Prevention**: Eliminates connections appearing/disappearing on return visits
- **Spatial Memory**: Maintains player mental map and world believability

#### Session Interface
- **Programmatic Access**: Execute commands without interactive CLI
- **Automation Support**: Ideal for testing, scripting, and external integrations
- **Game ID Targeting**: Command specific game sessions
- **Full Command Set**: All game and region commands available
