# Hub Progression and Artisans

This document outlines the system for evolving the central hub (The Heart of the Temple) and for player loot progression through the rescue of special artisan NPCs.

## 1. The Evolving Hub

The Heart of the Temple is not a static location. It is a construction project that grows and changes based on the player's actions and quest completions. As the player progresses through the mid-game, the hub will become more populated and functional, visually reflecting the restoration of hope and order to Aurelion.

## 2. Artisan NPCs and Loot Progression

A key part of the Hub's evolution is the rescue of master artisans. These characters, once saved, will take up residence in the Temple and become vendors, granting the player access to high-tier gear. This system provides the primary path for loot progression.

- **Mechanic:** Certain companion quests will feature an artisan who has been captured, enslaved, or forced into hiding by Urathar's forces.
- **Reward:** Rescuing an artisan is a major quest objective. Once they are brought back to the Hub, they will open a shop.
- **Loot Access:** These artisan vendors will sell unique, powerful items that are otherwise unavailable, directly rewarding the player's quest choices with tangible character power.

## 3. Integration with Companion Adventures

The rescue of these artisans will be woven into the narrative of specific companion quests. This adds another strategic layer to the player's choices within their 12-quest budget.

### Artisan Placement Examples:

- **The Master Armorer:**
  - **Location:** Found within **Canopy's** "Obsidian Mines" adventure.
  - **Narrative:** He was enslaved by Urathar to forge armor for his elite lieutenants.
  - **Unlocks:** The highest tier of heavy armor and shields.

- **The Master Weaponsmith:**
  - **Location:** Imprisoned within **Yorna's** "Fort Drakon" adventure.
  - **Narrative:** A celebrated smith forced to produce weapons for the enemy army.
  - **Unlocks:** A selection of unique, master-crafted melee weapons.

- **The Master Bowyer:**
  - **Location:** Discovered in a hidden workshop during **Twil's** "Undercity of Aurelion" adventure.
  - **Narrative:** He went into hiding when the city fell and has been surviving by his wits.
  - **Unlocks:** The game's best bows and a variety of powerful, special-effect arrows.

- **The Royal Alchemist:**
  - **Location:** Trapped in a magically sealed laboratory within **Hola's** "Whispering Library" adventure.
  - **Narrative:** She was researching a counter-agent to Urathar's blight when she was trapped.
  - **Unlocks:** The ability to purchase or craft powerful potions, poisons, and item enchantments.

## 4. Player Choice

This system deepens the strategic element of the game. When selecting from the available companion adventures, the player must now constantly weigh their priorities:
- Do I pursue a quest that unlocks a powerful new sword?
- Or do I choose the one that weakens Urathar's final army?
- Or the one that helps restore the All-Priest's memory?

This tension makes every choice within the 12-quest limit a meaningful one.
