# Character Faith and Secret Endings

This document details the role of the "All" religion in shaping companion personalities and outlines the design for a secret "true love" ending.

## 1. The Faith of the All

In the world of Aurelion, faith in the one true God, the "All," is a significant cultural and personal element. Devotion to the All is consistently portrayed as a positive trait, associated with honesty, hope, compassion, and an underlying desire for peace.

While not all companions are religious, those who are devout draw great inner strength from their beliefs. This provides a key motivational insight into their character.

## 2. The Devout Companions

This section identifies the companions who are devout followers of the All and describes how their faith informs their personality.

- **Canopy:** Her healing abilities are not just a skill but are framed as a form of prayer. Her personal quest to find her sister evolves into a holy mission to protect all innocents and cleanse the land of Urathar's blight.

- **Nellis:** As the potential successor to the All-Priest, she is the most traditionally religious character. Her quest to honor the fallen is a sacred duty, and her quiet steadiness comes from an unwavering faith that provides comfort to those around her.

- **Urn:** Her relentless optimism is a direct expression of her simple, powerful faith. She truly believes that the All will see them through the darkness, making her a beacon of hope even when the situation is dire.

## 3. Secret Ending: The Marriage of Canopy

To reward players who choose a path of singular devotion, a special "true love" ending with Canopy is available.

- **Title:** The Vow of a Singular Heart
- **Trigger Conditions:** All of the following must be true:
    1. The player must successfully defeat the final boss, Urathar.
    2. Canopy must be in the active party during the final battle.
    3. Canopy's affinity must be at the absolute maximum (10.0).
    4. No other companion in the entire game may have an affinity level greater than 9.0.

- **Outcome:** If all conditions are met, a unique post-credits scene will play. In the restored Heart of the Temple, with Queen Rose and the new All-Priestess Nellis officiating, the player character and Canopy are married. The scene is quiet, personal, and heartfelt, described as a "happily ever after."

- **Design Intent:** This ending serves as a special reward for players who choose a monogamous path in a game with multiple romantic options. It provides a unique and emotionally satisfying conclusion that stands apart from the game's other endings, enhancing replayability for players who want to discover this "easter egg."
