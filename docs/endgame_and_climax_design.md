# Endgame and Climax Design

This document outlines the foundational design for the game's two-part climax, which begins after the player completes 12 companion adventures.

## 1. Overview: The Two-Part Climax

The endgame is structured to provide a satisfying conclusion to both the player's personal power progression and their strategic decisions. It is composed of two simultaneous events:

1.  **The Action Climax:** The final, personal battle against Urathar in his fortress.
2.  **The Strategic Climax:** The large-scale defense of Aurelion, the outcome of which is determined by the player's prior investments.

## 2. Part I: The Final Boss - Urathar

This is the culmination of the player's combat journey.

- **Location:** A new, final level representing Urathar's inner sanctum.
- **Boss Design:** The fight against Urathar will be a complex, multi-phase encounter. He will be a large-scale boss utilizing a variety of powerful magical and physical area-of-effect attacks.
- **Party Requirements:** This battle requires a full party of three companions, all of whom must be at maximum affinity to stand a chance.

### Crucial Design Rule: No Required Companions

To ensure all player choices are respected, the Urathar boss fight **will not** require any single, specific companion for victory. There will be no immunities or mechanics that only one companion can counter.

- **Synergistic Victory:** Success will depend on the player's skill and the synergy of the team they have chosen to build. All combinations of three max-affinity companions will present a viable, winnable strategy.
- **Archetype Contributions:**
    - **DPS (e.g., Yorna, Cowsill):** Help burn through Urathar's massive health pool.
    - **Healers (e.g., Canopy, Urn):** Provide the sustain needed to survive his devastating attacks.
    - **Control/Debuff (e.g., Hola, Twil):** Create openings and mitigate threats by slowing Urathar or his minions.
    - **Defense (e.g., Nellis):** Offer powerful defensive buffs to protect the party during high-damage phases.

## 3. Part II: The Strategic Defense of Aurelion

This system provides a narrative payoff for the player's strategic decisions throughout the game.

- **Mechanic:** During the final phase, the player can invest resources (gold, special materials, etc.) into several "Defense Stations" around Aurelion. The player will not have enough resources to fully upgrade every station, forcing a final strategic choice.
- **Consequences:** The success level of each station does not determine victory or defeat, but rather shapes the epilogue. It dictates the state of the world after the final battle is won.

### Defense Station Examples:

- **Station: The Main Gate**
  - **Success:** The gate holds. The city's main entrance is pristine in the epilogue.
  - **Failure:** The gate is breached. The entrance district is in ruins, and the city feels more scarred by the war.

- **Station: The Temple Spires (Air Defense)**
  - **Success:** Mages and archers in the spires successfully repel Urathar's aerial forces. The upper districts are unharmed.
  - **Failure:** Flying minions break through the defenses, causing visible damage to the Temple and surrounding rooftops.

- **Station: The Undercity Shelters**
  - **Success:** The civilian shelters are well-supplied and hold strong. All named civilian NPCs survive.
  - **Failure:** The shelters are compromised. While no major characters are lost, the epilogue will mention civilian casualties, adding a somber note to the victory.
