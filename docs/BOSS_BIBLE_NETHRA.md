# Boss Bible: Nethra

-   **Level:** 2 (The Desert)
-   **Role:** Sorceress of the Sunken City
-   **Personality:** Vain, arrogant, and obsessed with magical power. Nethra commands the magic of the desertâ€”sand, sun, and illusion. She sees herself not as a mere commander, but as the rightful queen of the desert.
-   **Guardian:** **Aarg**, a magnificent blue dragon. Nethra did not create Aarg, but bound the proud creature to her will using powerful magic found in the desert ruins. The dragon's servitude is a constant struggle of wills, making it an incredibly dangerous and resentful guardian.
-   **Motivation:** To unearth the powerful magical artifacts of the sunken city she occupies, believing they will grant her enough power to challenge even Vorthak for Urathar's favor.
