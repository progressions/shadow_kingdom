# Boss Bible: Vorthak

-   **Level:** 5 (The Temple)
-   **Role:** Urathar's Top General and Conqueror of the Temple
-   **Appearance:** A huge, terrifying red monster covered in sharp spikes.
-   **Personality:** Vorthak is the incarnation of brutal, physical dominance and sadism. He is not a subtle commander; he is a force of nature who delights in the suffering of others. His cruelty is legendary, even among Urathar's forces, far surpassing that of his subordinates like Luula.
-   **Guardian:** **Fana**. Vorthak enslaved the powerful sorceress Fana not for simple pragmatism, but for the sadistic pleasure of breaking a strong-willed individual and turning her into his unwilling puppet. Her torment is a testament to his philosophy: power is best demonstrated by making the strong serve the stronger.
-   **Motivation:** To unlock and control the ancient power at the heart of the Temple. For Vorthak, this power is not just a tool for victory, but the ultimate means to inflict his cruelty upon the entire world, ensuring an age of suffering under his rule.
