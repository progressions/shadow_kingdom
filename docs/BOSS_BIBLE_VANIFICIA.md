# Boss Bible: Vanificia

-   **Level:** 4 (The City Ruins)
-   **Role:** Necromancer-Aristocrat of the City Ruins
-   **Personality:** Cold, calculating, and utterly detached from morality. Vanificia is a former Aurelion noble who saw Urathar's invasion as an opportunity. She practices the forbidden art of necromancy, viewing the dead as superior servantsâ€”they do not question, and they do not tire.
-   **Guardian:** **Wight**. The Wight is her masterpiece, the reanimated corpse of a former rival knight from another noble house. It is bound by powerful necromantic spells, an eternal, silent testament to her power and cruelty, forced to protect the very person who destroyed it.
-   **Motivation:** To amass an undead army from the city's countless dead and establish her own, eternal kingdom within the ruins, free from the petty squabbles of the living.
