# Story Bible: Hola

### 1. Background

Hola is a gifted sorceress whose power over the wind is a direct blessing from the All. However, this great power terrifies her. She is acutely aware of how much destruction her magic could cause if misused, and this fear makes her nervous, hesitant, and constantly in need of reassurance. She is found on Level 1, overwhelmed by the chaos of the invasion and afraid to use her powers, lest she make things worse.

### 2. Temperament & Personality

-   **Temperament:** **Nurturing**

Hola expresses her Nurturing temperament through a deep desire to protect others from harm—including the potential harm from her own untamed abilities. She is gentle, soft-spoken, and her dialogue is often phrased as questions. Her journey is about gaining the confidence to match her immense power, guided by the player's steady hand.

### 3. Wooing Approach (The Romantic Lens)

Hola is won over by a player who is patient, kind, and encouraging. He must be the calm anchor for her anxious energy. She is drawn to his strength, but more so to his capacity for gentleness. She shows her growing affection not through bold declarations, but through quiet, steadfast loyalty and by using her powerful magic to meticulously keep him safe from every projectile and to control the flow of every battle.

### 4. Auras (Passive Abilities)

Hola's passive auras are exceptionally powerful for controlling the battlefield and mitigating damage.

-   **Slowing Aura:** Creates a constant field of slowing air around the player.
-   **Wind Ward:** Provides a very strong passive resistance to ranged and projectile damage.
-   **Wind Deflection:** Has a constant chance to deflect incoming projectiles near the player.
-   **Slipstream:** Passively reduces the player's dash cooldown.

### 5. Triggers (Active Abilities)

-   **Gust!:** When enemies get too close, she releases a "gust" of wind that pushes them back and slows them.
-   **Slipstream (Affinity 8+):** When the player dashes, she temporarily boosts their dash cooldown rate.
-   **Maelstrom (Affinity 10+):** When surrounded by a large group of enemies, she unleashes a powerful "maelstrom" that knocks them back, heavily slows them, and increases her deflection chance.

### 6. Clashes

-   **Aggression:** Hola is deeply uncomfortable with being put in aggressive, frontline roles. Her intro clash, `"Frontline with me—we need a brawler,"` is the opposite of her nature.
-   **Impatience:** A player who is impatient with her hesitation or who dismisses her fears will quickly lose her trust.
-   **Affection for Nellis:** Her natural synergy is with Nellis. The steady, faithful Nellis provides a calming presence that soothes Hola's anxiety.

### 7. Theme (Method of Help)

Hola's theme is: **"We win by being careful and controlling the fight."**

She believes that victory comes not from overwhelming force, but from careful management of the battlefield. Her philosophy is to use her wind magic to slow enemies, deflect their attacks, and keep them at a safe distance, ensuring the player is never overwhelmed and can win the battle on his own terms.
