# Story Bible: Yorna

### 1. Background

A ruthless and supremely confident warrior, Yorna thrives in the chaos of Urathar's invasion. To her, the world is simple: you are either strong enough to take what you want, or you are weak enough to have it taken from you. She respects only strength and is constantly testing those around her. She is found on Level 1, sizing up the player, not as a friend, but as a potential tool or a potential leader.

### 2. Temperament & Personality

-   **Temperament:** **Exacting**

Yorna's exacting standards are purely martial. She demands efficiency, aggression, and perfection in combat from herself and from the player. There is no room for wasted movement, hesitation, or sentimentality. Her philosophy is one of constant, forward momentum, and she has no patience for anything that slows her down.

### 3. Wooing Approach (The Romantic Lens)

Yorna is not wooed by kindness or words, but by overwhelming strength and a shared killer instinct. Her affection for the player grows only as he proves his own ruthlessness and capability in battle. She shows her respect—her version of love—by acknowledging his strength, pushing him to be even more aggressive, and eventually, by fighting not just near him, but *for* him. Her romance is a partnership of apex predators.

### 4. Auras (Passive Abilities)

-   **Warrior's Presence:** Passively increases the player's attack and range.

### 5. Triggers (Active Abilities)

Yorna's abilities are focused on relentless offense and punishing enemy weakness.

-   **On-Hit Strike:** Every time the player lands a hit, Yorna adds a burst of bonus damage.
-   **Expose Weakness (Affinity 8+):** When the player dashes or lands a critical hit, Yorna debuffs nearby enemies, reducing their armor.
-   **Execution Window (Affinity 10+):** When the player dashes or crits, Yorna's own attacks gain a massive temporary damage boost, including armor-piercing and true damage.

### 6. Clashes

-   **Weakness & Hesitation:** Any sign of weakness, indecisiveness, or prioritizing mercy over victory is contemptible to Yorna.
-   **Support Roles:** Asking her to do anything other than fight on the front line is the ultimate insult. Her intro clash, `"Hang back and patch me up, alright?"` is a prime example.
-   **Rivalry with Canopy:** Her worldview is the polar opposite of Canopy's. She sees Canopy's defensive, protective nature as naive and dangerous weakness, leading to a constant, bitter rivalry.

### 7. Theme (Method of Help)

Yorna's theme is: **"We win by being stronger and more ruthless than our enemies."**

She believes that victory is an act of will, imposed on the world through superior force. Her philosophy is to identify the biggest threat and eliminate it as quickly and brutally as possible. She is the tip of the spear, driving directly into the heart of the enemy.
