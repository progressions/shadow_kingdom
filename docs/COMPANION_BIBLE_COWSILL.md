# Story Bible: Cowsill

### 1. Background

Cowsill is a devout Priestess of the All, but where others of her faith focus on healing and contemplation, she was trained by the temple's own formal guard. She is a holy warrior, a member of the church militant who believes that faith is a weapon and that some evils must be met with overwhelming, righteous force. She is energetic, positive, and earnest. She is found on Level 5, fighting to reclaim the desecrated Temple from Vorthak's forces.

### 2. Temperament & Personality

-   **Temperament:** **Playful/Steady**

Cowsill embodies this unique hybrid temperament. Her **Playful** side is her boundless energy and positive attitude, even in a fight. She finds joy in perfect execution and battlefield synergy. Her **Steady** side is her adherence to the temple's doctrines and the "right way" to fight evil. She is not a reckless brawler; she is a trained, by-the-book holy warrior.

### 3. Wooing Approach (The Romantic Lens)

Cowsill is looking for a leader worthy of her faith and her strength. She is attracted to a player who is decisive, righteous, and whose commands she can follow with absolute confidence. Her affection grows as he proves himself to be a capable and honorable commander. She shows her love through unwavering loyalty, acting as the flawless instrument of his will on the battlefieldâ€”his most powerful and devoted holy warrior.

### 4. Auras (Passive Abilities)

-   **Striker Synergy:** Provides a very strong passive attack boost to the player.
-   **Quick Strikes:** Grants a passive increase to the player's attack speed.

### 5. Triggers (Active Abilities)

Cowsill's abilities are entirely focused on dealing massive, synergistic melee damage.

-   **Echo Strike:** Her core ability. Every time the player lands a hit, she adds a burst of bonus damage.
-   **Double Strike:** Her own attacks have a chance to hit a second time instantly.
-   **Crescendo (Affinity 8+):** After a rapid sequence of hits, her next attack deals massively increased damage.
-   **Encore (Affinity 10+):** Allows her to repeat her last melee attack as a series of devastating "ghost hits."

### 6. Clashes

-   **Being sidelined:** Cowsill's purpose is to be a primary damage dealer. Her intro clash, `"We actually need a healer more than damage,"` fundamentally misunderstands her holy duty.
-   **Cynicism:** Her earnest, by-the-book faith clashes with cynical or pragmatic viewpoints, which is the core of her rivalry with the tactician **Varabella**.
-   **Affection for Yorna:** She shares a mutual respect with **Yorna**, seeing her as another top-tier warrior, even if Yorna's methods are more ruthless than her own.

### 7. Theme (Method of Help)

Cowsill's theme is: **"We win by striking evil down with righteous, overwhelming force."**

She believes that faith is best expressed through decisive action. Her philosophy is to meet evil head-on with a combination of trained martial prowess and holy power, purifying the land by destroying corruption at its source. She is the holy hammer of the party.
