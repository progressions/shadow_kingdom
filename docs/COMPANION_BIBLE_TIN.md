# Story Bible: Tin

### 1. Background

A hyperactive and enthusiastic speedster, Tin was captured by Luula's forces in the early days of the Aurelion invasion. Like Nellis, she was subjected to Luula's cruelty but managed to escape. She is now in hiding in the northeastern region of the Marsh (Level 3), constantly on the move to evade Luula's soldiers who are actively hunting her.

Her initial introduction to the player comes via a quest from Nellis. As a fellow escapee, Nellis feels a responsibility to find and rescue Tin, creating a bond of shared trauma between the two otherwise very different women.

### 2. Temperament & Personality

-   **Temperament:** **Playful**

Tin is defined by her boundless energy and wit. She is always in motion, speaks in rapid-fire sentences, and enjoys banter. Her hyperactivity, however, may be a coping mechanism; she has to keep moving, physically and mentally, to keep the memories of her capture at bay. Her playfulness is a survival tool, a way to outrun the darkness.

### 3. Wooing Approach (The Romantic Lens)

Tin's wooing approach is to turn everything into a game. She will challenge the player to races, make light-hearted bets in the middle of combat, and constantly tease him. She shows her affection by trying to pull him into her world of speed and fun, making the grim reality of their quest feel like an exciting adventure. To win her heart, the player must engage in her games, appreciate her humor, and, most importantly, be able to keep up.

### 4. Auras (Passive Abilities)

-   **Hype:** Increases the player's base attack speed.
-   **Slipstream:** Reduces the player's dash cooldown, allowing for more frequent movement.
-   **Water Affinity:** Allows the player to walk on water, opening up new paths.

### 5. Triggers (Active Abilities)

-   **Slipstream!:** When enemies are near, Tin creates a small push/slow effect and temporarily buffs the player's attack range.
-   **Tumble Up!:** When the player takes a hit, Tin heals him for 1 HP and grants a temporary attack buff.
-   **Overclock (Affinity 8+):** After the player performs a dash combo, Tin grants a significant temporary boost to attack speed and dash cooldown reduction.
-   **Symphony (Affinity 10+):** After a dash combo, Tin grants a massive temporary boost to attack speed and critical hit chance, and also instantly resets the player's dash cooldown.

### 6. Clashes

-   **Slowness and Seriousness:** Tin clashes with slow, methodical approaches and overly serious or humorless attitudes. Her intro clash line is, `"We need slow and steady, not fast."`, which is the antithesis of her philosophy.
-   **Rivalry with Twil:** Her primary rival is Twil. Their rivalry is a friendly but intense competition of speed and elemental powerâ€”Tin's fluid, water-based celerity versus Twil's explosive, fire-based intensity.

### 7. Theme (Method of Help)

Tin's theme is: **"We win by setting the tempo and never stopping."**

She believes that victory is achieved through overwhelming speed and momentum. Her strategy is to move faster than the enemy can react, turning combat into a dance where she and the player are always one step ahead.
