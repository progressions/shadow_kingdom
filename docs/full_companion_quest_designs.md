# Full Companion Quest Designs (Affinity-Based)

**Design Note on Quest Structure:** The Low, Medium, and High affinity sections for each companion do **not** describe three different quests. Instead, they describe three potential paths and outcomes within a **single, core adventure** for that companion. The path taken is determined by the player's affinity level at the time the quest is undertaken, leading to different dialogue, challenges, and rewards.

This document provides the Low, Medium, and High affinity-based quest designs for every companion, following the pattern established in `companion_quest_affinity_design.md`.
