# Companion Guide (Master Document)

## 1. Overview
Companions are the heart of the adventure in Shadow Kingdom. They are recruitable NPCs who follow the player, provide passive auras, and trigger special abilities. All companions are romantically interested in the player, and building a relationship (affinity) with them is key to unlocking their full potential, their personal stories, and unique gameplay outcomes.

## 2. Core Companion Mechanics

### Affinity
- **Scale:** A 1-10 numeric scale representing a companion's affection and trust for the player.
- **Growth:** Affinity is gained by completing companion-specific quests, choosing supportive dialogue options, and giving gifts.
- **Effects:** Higher affinity increases the power of a companion's abilities and unlocks new dialogue, romantic quests, and story branches.

### Companion Relationships
Companions have their own rivalries and affections, which create a dynamic social ecosystem within the party.
- **Rivalries:** Certain companions clash in personality or philosophy. At low player affinity (<5.0), a companion will refuse to join a party that contains their rival. At high affinity (>=5.0), they will join, stating they are doing it for the player.
- **Affections:** Certain companions have a natural synergy. When in the party together, they activate a unique, passive "Synergy Aura."
- **Low-Affinity Debuffs:** A companion with very low affinity (<3.0) will apply a minor negative debuff to the party, representing their discontent.

### Quests
- **Adventure Quests:** Each companion offers a quest line to a new location to acquire a "key" to defeating Urathar. These quests change based on affinity.
- **Romantic Quests:** At high affinity (8.0+), companions unlock a dialogue-heavy "romantic quest" in the Hub, which is required to reach max affinity (10.0).
