# Boss Bible: Vast

-   **Level:** 1 (The Greenwood)
-   **Role:** Warlord of the Greenwood
-   **Personality:** A brutish and pragmatic commander who uses terror and intimidation to control her domain. She is not a grand strategist, but a blunt instrument of Urathar's will, focused on resource gathering and crushing local resistance.
-   **Guardian:** **Gorg**, an ancient and powerful beast of the forest. Vast didn't create Gorg; she captured and subjugated the beast, seeing it as the ultimate symbol of her domination over the Greenwood. Gorg fights with a broken spirit, making it a tragic figure.
-   **Motivation:** To strip the Greenwood of resources for Urathar's army and to consolidate her own power base by hiring local bandits. She captured Ell from the bandits to sell to Vorthak as a high-value prisoner, seeing it as a simple, profitable transaction.
