# Story Bible: Varabella

### 1. Background

Varabella is a sharp-eyed, precise, and deeply cynical field tactician. Her cynicism was forged in the fires of Aurelion's fall, where she saw firsthand that good intentions don't stop swords. During the chaos, she formed an unlikely, protective bond with the optimistic Urn, adopting her as a sister. Varabella finds Urn's boundless hope baffling and naive, but also necessary. She sees it as her duty to handle the grim realities of survival so that her sister's light doesn't go out. She addresses the player with a sarcastic but respectful "Boss man."

### 2. Temperament & Personality

-   **Temperament:** **Practical**

Varabella is the ultimate pragmatist. She is unsentimental, results-oriented, and has no patience for inefficient, roundabout solutions. She believes every problem has a weak point, and her talent is finding it and telling you exactly how to press it. She doesn't deal in hope; she deals in angles, advantages, and enemy casualties.

### 3. Wooing Approach (The Romantic Lens)

Varabella respects competence, period. She is attracted to a player who is a smart and efficient leaderâ€”a "Boss man" worthy of the title. She shows her growing affection not with compliments, but with sharp, brutally honest tactical advice. Her version of a love letter is a perfectly executed battle plan. A player who listens to her, uses her insights effectively, and gets the job done without unnecessary risks will earn her loyalty and respect, which from her, is the same as love.

### 4. Auras (Passive Abilities)

-   **Tactical Awareness:** Passively increases the player's attack range.
-   **Sharp Eye:** Passively increases the player's critical hit chance.

### 5. Triggers (Active Abilities)

Varabella's abilities are all about creating and exploiting tactical advantages.

-   **Angle!:** When enemies are nearby, she grants a temporary buff to the player's attack and range.
-   **Perfect Angle (Affinity 8+):** When enemies are aligned, she empowers the player's next shot to pierce through them and deal bonus armor-piercing damage.
-   **Time Dilation (Affinity 10+):** In critical moments, she creates a field that slows all enemies and empowers the player's shots with piercing and a massive critical hit bonus.

### 6. Clashes

-   **Inefficiency:** Varabella despises wasted effort. Her intro clash, `"Save the angles; just swing hard,"` represents the kind of brute-force, thoughtless approach she cannot stand.
-   **Sentimentality:** While she protects Urn, she clashes with sentimental decisions that jeopardize the mission or the party's safety.
-   **Rivalry with Cowsill:** Her cynical pragmatism is the direct opposite of Cowsill's earnest, by-the-book faith, leading to a rivalry of philosophies.

### 7. Theme (Method of Help)

Varabella's theme is: **"We win by being smarter and more efficient than the enemy."**

She believes that strength is a resource, and it should be applied with maximum efficiency. Her role is to be the party's brain, analyzing the battlefield, identifying weaknesses, and providing the player with the perfect tactical solution to every combat problem.
