# Boss Bible: Luula

-   **Level:** 3 (The Marsh)
-   **Role:** Ambitious Commander of the Marsh
-   **Personality:** Cruel, sadistic, and intensely ambitious. Luula takes pleasure in tormenting her captives and subordinates. She is desperate to prove her worth and climb the ranks, making her reckless and prone to fits of rage when her plans are thwarted.
-   **Guardian:** **Blurb**, a large, simple-minded swamp creature. Luula controls Blurb not with complex magic, but with simple manipulation and promises of food. Blurb is a pet and a tool, and its loyalty is born of ignorance, not true devotion.
-   **Motivation:** To crush the refugee paths through the marsh and capture anyone of value. Her torture of Nellis and Tin were examples of her methodsâ€”she breaks those she thinks can be useful and discards the rest.
