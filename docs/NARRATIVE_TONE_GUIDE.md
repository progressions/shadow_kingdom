# Narrative Tone and Dialogue Guide

This document outlines the guiding principles for the narrative tone and character dialogue in Shadow Kingdom. The goal is to create a consistent, grounded, and character-driven experience.

## 1. Core Principles

### Plain Language, Evocative Feeling
The dialogue should always favor plain, direct language. Characters should say what they mean. However, this does not mean the dialogue should be flat or emotionless. The choice of simple words, the rhythm of the sentences, and the subtext of the situation should be what evokes feeling, not complex vocabulary, metaphors, or idioms.

The tone is grounded and realistic. Characters are in a dark, dangerous world, and their language should reflect a certain level of directness and practicality.

**Key takeaway:** Write dialogue that is easy to understand on the surface but carries emotional and character depth beneath it.

### Direct and Literal: No Metaphors or Idioms
Avoid poetic, metaphorical, or idiomatic language. This style can feel artificial and detract from the grounded tone we are aiming for.

- **BAD:** `Yorna: Chief, three wardens keep the causeway narrow. We widen it with their mistakes.`
- **GOOD:** `Yorna: Chief, three wardens are blocking the causeway. Let's kill them and open it up.`

- **BAD:** `Canopy: My Lord, stone bleeds too. Three streets run red—if we clear the hands that did it, people can pass.`
- **GOOD:** `Canopy: My Lord, these streets are dangerous. There are three areas controlled by hostiles. If we clear them out, people can travel safely.`

- **BAD:** `Yorna: Ring's cracked. The road breathes.`
- **GOOD:** `Yorna: The captains are dead. The road is clear.`

## 2. Character Dynamics

### Universal Romantic Interest
A core dynamic of the game is that **all companions have a romantic interest in the player character.** This is the primary lens through which their interactions with the player, and with each other, should be written. This interest should not always be overt, but it should underpin their motivations, their desire for the player's approval, and their rivalries.

### Distinct Character Voices
While the overall tone is consistent, each companion must retain their unique personality as defined in the `COMPANION_GUIDE.md`. The principle of "plain language" does not mean all characters sound the same.

- **Yorna** is aggressive and confident. Her plain language is clipped, direct, and action-oriented.
- **Canopy** is calm and protective. Her plain language is gentle, caring, and focused on safety and well-being.
- **Hola** is nervous and unsure. Her plain language is hesitant, often phrased as questions, and seeks reassurance.

## 3. Inter-Companion Dialogue

The companions' shared interest in the player is the main source of conflict and tension among them.

### Playfully Competitive
In most situations, the rivalry between companions should be playful and competitive. They are trying to prove their worth and win the player's affection and respect. This can manifest as:

- **Boasting:** Highlighting their own skills or accomplishments.
- **Teasing:** Lightly mocking or downplaying the abilities of other companions.
- **One-upmanship:** Offering to handle a task more effectively than a rival.

**Example:**
> `Yorna: Don't worry about them, Chief. The others can hang back and... 'support'. I'm the only vanguard you'll need.`

This line effectively shows Yorna's confidence and dismissiveness of the other companions' roles in a way that is competitive but not overtly hostile.

### Genuinely Antagonistic
In certain situations, especially when personalities clash under pressure, the rivalry can become genuinely antagonistic. These moments should feel earned and reflect the core conflicts between the characters' worldviews.

- **Yorna's** ruthless drive may clash with **Canopy's** cautious, protective nature.
- **Twil's** cocky speed could intimidate or frustrate the hesitant **Hola**.

These conflicts create opportunities for the player to intervene and mediate, strengthening their bond with the involved companions and shaping the party's dynamic.

Level 2 Feud Example (Canopy ↔ Yorna)
- Setup: Entering Level 2 with both in the party triggers a VN scene. The tone is direct, personal, and grounded — no metaphors/idioms.
- Sample beats:
  - Yorna: "Chief, she slows us. We push or we bleed. Pick."
  - Canopy: "My Lord, charge blind and you lose people. I won’t help with that."
  - Player chooses who stays. The choice is final until a later truce.
- Aftermath: The unchosen one refuses to join while the rival is present until respect is earned. Keep lines short and literal when expressing refusal.
