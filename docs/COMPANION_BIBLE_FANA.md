# Story Bible: Fana

### 1. Background

Fana is a sorceress of immense power from a forgotten order. She was captured by Vorthak and magically enslaved to serve as the final guardian of the Temple on Level 5. For an unknown amount of time, her will was not her own. The player encounters her as a tragic, powerful boss who they must defeat to proceed. Upon her defeat, Vorthak's control is broken, and she is freed. Grateful and fiercely loyal to her rescuer, she joins him, eager to reclaim her identity and unleash her power against her former captors.

### 2. Temperament & Personality

-   **Temperament:** **Exacting**

Fana's personality is a paradox. Having been enslaved, she can be hesitant and is rediscovering her own will. However, her core temperament is Exacting. This manifests as an intense, perfectionistic standard for her own magic and an absolute, uncompromising demand for justice against her enemies. Her hesitancy is a temporary shell; her true nature is one of passionate, overwhelming power and intensity.

### 3. Wooing Approach (The Romantic Lens)

Fana's affection for the player is one of profound, almost reverent devotion. She calls him "My Prince," seeing him as her savior and the one person who can help her reclaim her sense of self. She shows her love by dedicating her immense power to his cause. She is drawn to a player who is decisive, who encourages her to unleash her full strength, and who shares her desire to see their enemies utterly destroyed. For Fana, love is an act of fierce, absolute loyalty.

### 4. Auras (Passive Abilities)

*(Note: Fana's specific abilities are not yet implemented in `companion_effects.js`. The following are based on her character theme.)*

-   **Aura of Annihilation (Anticipated):** Likely a powerful offensive aura that increases the player's damage, possibly with a darkness-based theme that weakens enemies around her.

### 5. Triggers (Active Abilities)

*(Note: Fana's specific abilities are not yet implemented. The following are based on her character theme.)*

-   **Umbral Surge (Anticipated):** Her triggers are expected to be powerful, darkness-based magical attacks. Based on her intro dialogue ("burn what clings"), which can be interpreted as annihilating impurities, they will likely focus on heavy, direct damage or debilitating debuffs that erode enemy defenses.

### 6. Clashes

-   **Restraint:** Fana clashes with any suggestion that she should hold back her power. The line `"We need cold precision, not heat"` is a direct contradiction to her passionate, overwhelming magical style, regardless of its elemental nature.
-   **Mercy for the Unforgivable:** Showing mercy to the forces that enslaved her, or to any who use magic for domination, would be a major source of conflict. Her sense of justice is absolute.

### 7. Theme (Method of Help)

Fana's theme is: **"We win by extinguishing our enemies with overwhelming darkness."**

She believes that some evils cannot be negotiated with or contained; they must be scoured from the world completely. Her philosophy is to unleash her immense magical power to its fullest extent, eradicating the corruption of Urathar and Vorthak and ensuring that no one can ever suffer as she did.
