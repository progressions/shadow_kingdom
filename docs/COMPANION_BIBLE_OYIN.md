# Story Bible: Oyin

### 1. Background

Oyin is a young and earnest traveler from a background that did not prepare her for war. Driven by a powerful sense of duty and a desire to be useful, she has come to the harsh desert of Level 2 to contribute to the fight against Urathar's forces. She is inexperienced in combat and knows it, but she is a quick study and incredibly eager to learn and prove her worth. Her greatest fear is being seen as a burden.

### 2. Temperament & Personality

-   **Temperament:** **Steady**

Oyin's steadiness comes not from a place of stoicism or experience, but from her sheer determination and sense of duty. She is reliable because she tries her absolute hardest to be. She is focused, diligent, and follows instructions to the letter. She is the dedicated apprentice, always watching, learning, and trying to anticipate what needs to be done next.

### 3. Wooing Approach (The Romantic Lens)

Oyin is drawn to a player who is a patient and encouraging mentor. She sees him as a leader to learn from, and her affection grows as he invests time in teaching her. She shows her love through acts of service and by proving her reliability. Her goal is to become his indispensable aide, the one he can always count on to handle the crucial details that others might overlook. A player who acknowledges her hard work and praises her progress will win her heart.

### 4. Auras (Passive Abilities)

-   **Slowing Aura:** Passively slows enemies in an area around the player.
-   **Sturdiness:** Provides a small, constant damage reduction to the player.
-   **Focus:** Grants a small, passive critical hit chance bonus to the player.

### 5. Triggers (Active Abilities)

-   **Dust Veil:** When at least two enemies are near, she releases a pulse of dust, heavily slowing them for a short duration to control the battlefield.
-   **Rally!:** When the player's health is low, she provides a clutch burst of healing and a temporary attack buff, turning a dangerous situation around.

### 6. Clashes

-   **Dismissiveness:** Oyin's primary clash is with being dismissed due to her inexperience. The line `"I need a seasoned striker right now"` invalidates her desire to learn and be useful.
-   **Impatience:** A player who is impatient with her learning process or who doesn't explain things clearly will cause her to lose confidence and trust.

### 7. Theme (Method of Help)

Oyin's theme is: **"We win by being prepared and supporting each other when it matters most."**

She believes victory is not just about the fighting, but about the preparation, logistics, and support that make fighting possible. She excels at tasks that require diligence and a steady hand, and in combat, her abilities are focused on controlling the environment and providing critical support at the most decisive moments.
