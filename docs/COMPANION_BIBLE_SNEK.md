# Story Bible: Snek

### 1. Background

Snek is not just a snake; he is a legend. An ancient, wise, and slightly grumpy spirit of the Greenwood, Snek has slumbered for centuries, waking only for events of great importance or for someone worthy of his attention. He is a secret companion, available only when "snakeMode" is active, a mysterious condition of the world that seems to occur only when a truly special hero (or one with a cool dad) is present.

He is not a victim of the war or a refugee. He has seen empires rise and fall, and this latest conflict is but one more chapter in a very long book. He aids the player not out of duty, but mostly because he finds his quest amusing and a welcome break from the monotony of a long nap.

### 2. Temperament & Personality

-   **Temperament:** **Nurturing (Lite)**

Snek's nurturing style is that of a wise, crotchety grandfather. He will absolutely help keep you safe, but he might be a little sarcastic about it (in his own hissy way). He provides support through crowd control and steady pressure, ensuring the player isn't overwhelmed while Snek gets a front-row seat to the action.

### 3. Wooing Approach (The Romantic Lens)

Snek is not a romantic option. His "affinity" is a measure of his respect and amusement. The player earns Snek's favor not with gifts or kindness, but by being an effective and entertaining warrior. Snek appreciates impressive combat, clever tactics, and the occasional bit of dramatic flair. He shows his growing respect by using his more powerful abilities to help.

### 4. Auras (Passive Abilities)

-   **Venomous Presence:** A faint, venomous aura that slightly slows enemies near the player.
-   **Fang Focus:** Provides a small, passive attack buff to the player.

### 5. Triggers (Active Abilities)

-   **Venom Cloud (Affinity 8+):** When enemies are near, Snek releases a cloud of venom that slows them and deals poison damage over time.
-   **Constriction (Affinity 10+):** When at least one enemy is near, Snek summons a powerful magical field that heavily slows and poisons them.

### 6. Clashes

-   **Disrespecting his Snek-ness:** Snek finds it very droll when mortals complain about his lack of arms or thumbs. The line `"I was hoping forâ€¦ thumbs"` is the kind of joke he has heard for a thousand years, and while he's not truly offended, he is unimpressed.
-   **Being Boring:** The greatest sin in Snek's eyes is to be boring. A player who is overly cautious, predictable, or inefficient will quickly lose his interest.

### 7. Theme (Method of Help)

Snek's theme is: **"We win because ancient serpent magic is obviously the best magic."**

His philosophy is that of an ancient power who is above the petty squabbles of men, but is willing to lend his strength to a worthy cause, especially if that cause is entertaining. He uses his unique venom and constricting power to control the battlefield in ways no two-legged companion can.
