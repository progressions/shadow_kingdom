# Story Bible: Urn

### 1. Background

Urn is an unwavering beacon of hope in a world consumed by darkness. During the fall of Aurelion, she witnessed terrible things, but her response was not to grow cynical, but to double down on her simple, powerful faith in the goodness of people. In the chaos, she bonded with the pragmatic tactician Varabella, and the two became inseparable, adopted sisters. Urn provides the hope, and Varabella ensures they survive. They are found together on Level 4, trying to help other refugees.

### 2. Temperament & Personality

-   **Temperament:** **Nurturing**

Urn's nurturing nature is expressed through boundless optimism and encouragement. She believes that the biggest wounds are to the people's spirit, and she sees it as her holy duty to heal them. She is a source of endless positivity, and her simple faith that things *can* get better is often the deciding factor in a hopeless situation.

### 3. Wooing Approach (The Romantic Lens)

Urn is drawn to a player who is a protector of the innocent. She sees the good in him and wants to nurture it. Her affection grows when he makes compassionate choices, helps others, and shows that he is fighting for a better world, not just for personal power. She shows her love by being his constant source of hope, lifting his spirits, and reminding him of the good they are fighting for.

### 4. Auras (Passive Abilities)

-   **Light of Hope:** Provides a small, constant health regeneration to the player.

### 5. Triggers (Active Abilities)

-   **Cheer!:** When the player's health is low, Urn lets out a magical cheer that provides a significant burst of healing and a temporary attack speed buff.
-   **Beacon Surge (Affinity 8+):** When enemies are dense and the player is in danger, she unleashes a powerful surge of light, providing an even stronger heal and a minor attack speed buff.

### 6. Clashes

-   **Cynicism and Cruelty:** Urn clashes with unnecessary cruelty and hopeless cynicism. While she understands the pragmatic arguments of her sister, Varabella, she cannot abide by actions that sacrifice hope for efficiency.
-   **Dismissiveness:** Her intro clash, `"I need a hard hitter, not a cheer,"` shows a fundamental misunderstanding of her role. She believes hope and morale are the most powerful weapons.

### 7. Theme (Method of Help)

Urn's theme is: **"We win by giving people the hope and strength to fight on."**

She believes that battles are won in the heart before they are won on the field. Her role is to be the emotional and spiritual core of the party, ensuring that no matter how dire the situation, the player and his allies never lose the will to continue.
