# Story Bible: Nellis

### 1. Background

Nellis lived with her family on the peaceful outskirts of the great city of Aurelion. Before the war, she was befriended by Luula, who gained her trust and eventually convinced her to join a new, promising movement in service of the charismatic leader Urathar. Nellis, believing she was part of a cause for order and strength, agreed.

This was a deception. A year ago, Urathar's army, led by the warlord Vorthak, invaded and conquered Aurelion. Nellis was swept into the invasion as a soldier, where she was commanded to perform acts of cruelty she could not stomach. Her conscience rebelled, and she refused to follow a direct order. Her punishment was delivered by her former "friend," Luula, who tortured her for her insubordination. Broken and covered in wounds that now require constant bandages, Nellis barely escaped with her life, finding refuge just before the player encounters her on Level 3.

### 2. Temperament & Personality

-   **Temperament:** **Steady** (in a state of recovery)

While Nellis's current emotional state is defined by sadness and trauma, her core personality aligns with the **Steady** temperament. Her sadness is not her identity, but a wound she is recovering from. She fundamentally craves the order, safety, and moral clarity that was stolen from her by Luula's betrayal.

She looks to the player for the support and guidance she currently lacks. Her journey is about reclaiming her innate steadiness. As her affinity with the player grows, her confidence builds, and her true, dependable nature begins to surface.

### 3. Wooing Approach (The Romantic Lens)

Nellis's wooing approach is one of **vulnerability and earned trust**. Initially, she shows her growing affection by placing her complete faith in the player, looking to him as her anchor in a chaotic world. She trusts him to guide her, protect her, and help her heal from her deep betrayal.

As her affinity and confidence grow, her approach evolves. She begins to mirror the player's strength. Her romantic gestures become acts of service and protection. She starts by needing a rock, and her ultimate expression of love is to *become* a rock for the player in return.

### 4. Aura (Passive Ability)

As defined in the code, Nellis has one passive, always-on aura:

-   **Steady Pace:** Provides a small, constant damage reduction (`DR +1`) to the player, representing her stabilizing presence.

### 5. Triggers (Active Abilities)

Triggers are magical abilities that activate automatically under specific combat conditions.

-   **Keep the Line:** When the player's health is low, Nellis grants him a temporary boost to `touchDR` and creates a small field around them that slows enemies.
-   **Mourner's Veil:** When at least two enemies are near, she releases a pulse that briefly slows them.
-   **Beacon:** When enemies are nearby, she grants the player a short-term `range` buff.
-   **Phalanx (Affinity 8+):** When at least two enemies are near, she grants a significant temporary boost to `touchDR`.
-   **Bulwark (Affinity 10+):** When at least three enemies are near, she grants a powerful temporary boost to both `rangedDR` and `touchDR`.

### 6. Clashes

These are the actions and situations that conflict with her temperament and cause disapproval.

-   **Chaos and Recklessness:** Hasty, ill-considered plans remind her of the violent unpredictability of Vorthak's army.
-   **Casual Cruelty:** Forcing her to engage in or witness acts of unnecessary cruelty is her strongest trigger. It directly conflicts with the reason she rebelled and makes her feel she is being pushed back toward the evil she escaped.
-   **Dismissing Her Contribution:** As she fights to regain her confidence, being told to "stay back" or having her efforts belittled is deeply damaging, as it invalidates the trust she has placed in the player.

### 7. Theme (Method of Help)

Nellis's theme is: **"We win by holding our ground and enduring."**

Her approach to conflict is not about aggressive charges or clever tactics. It is about resilience. She believes victory is achieved by planting your feet, preparing for the blow, and refusing to be moved. Her philosophy is to outlast the enemy, to be the unbreachable wall that protects the party.
