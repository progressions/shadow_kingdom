# Story Bible: Canopy

### 1. Background

Canopy escaped the city of Aurelion during Urathar's recent, brutal invasion. Her inciting incident is that in the chaos, her sister Ell was captured by bandits. Canopy has been tracking them relentlessly, and her pursuit has led her to the Greenwood and the fortress of the local warlord, Vast. While she doesn't know the whole truth, she has heard rumors that Vast is using bandits to terrorize the populace. Her immediate goal when the player meets her is to find out if Vast knows what happened to her sister. As the first friendly face the player meets, she is the moral compass of the early game, introducing him to the compassionate path and the idea that one can fight to protect, not just to destroy.

### 2. Temperament & Personality

-   **Temperament:** **Nurturing**

Canopy is the archetypal healer. She is warm, reassuring, and always puts the well-being of others first. Her actions are guided by her devout worship of the All, the primary religion in Aurelion. It describes the one true God who created the world and loves all His people. She is patient and forgiving, but her calm demeanor hides a fierce determination to protect those in her care.

### 3. Wooing Approach (The Romantic Lens)

Canopy's affection for the player grows from her admiration for his strength and his capacity for kindness. She woos him not with banter or challenges, but with unwavering support, constant healing, and gentle guidance. She is drawn to a player who makes compassionate choices, who helps others, and who values her for her protective gifts rather than just her fighting ability. For Canopy, love is the ultimate act of protection.

### 4. Auras (Passive Abilities)

-   **Protective Aura:** Provides a small, constant damage reduction (`DR +1`) to the player.
-   **Regeneration:** Her most potent ability, providing a constant, passive health regeneration to the player that is invaluable throughout the entire game.

### 5. Triggers (Active Abilities)

-   **Shield:** When the player's health drops to a low threshold, she automatically grants him a temporary shield to prevent further damage.
-   **Dash Mend (Affinity 5+):** Every time the player dashes, she provides a small burst of healing.
-   **Aegis (Affinity 8+):** When the player is hit, she grants a temporary damage reduction buff and another small heal.
-   **Guardian Veil (Affinity 10+):** When surrounded by a dense group of enemies, she provides a powerful, short-duration shield to weather the assault.

### 6. Clashes

-   **Needless Aggression:** Canopy clashes with a worldview that prioritizes violence over safety. Her intro clash, `"I could use another pair of fighting handsâ€”join up,"` shows her dislike for being seen as a simple soldier rather than a protector.
-   **Rivalry with Yorna:** Her core conflict is with Yorna. Canopy sees Yorna's methods as reckless and destructive, while Yorna sees Canopy's caution as weakness. This represents the fundamental clash between protection and aggression.

### 7. Theme (Method of Help)

Canopy's theme is: **"We win by enduring, and by protecting what is good."**

She believes that true victory is not about how many enemies you kill, but about how many people you save. Her philosophy is one of resilience and compassion. She ensures the player can outlast any foe, healing his wounds and shielding him from harm so that he can continue to be a beacon of hope in a dark world.
