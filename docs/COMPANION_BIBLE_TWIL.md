# Story Bible: Twil

### 1. Background

Twil is a supremely confident and cocky scout, unparalleled in her ability to track enemies and read the terrain. She survived the wilds on her own for years, relying on her wits, her speed, and her mastery of fire magic to stay alive. She sees survival as a game of wits, and she has never lost. Her services are highly sought after, and she knows it. She is found on Level 2, tracking a high-value target for her own purposes before she agrees to join the player.

### 2. Temperament & Personality

-   **Temperament:** **Playful**

Twil is defined by her sharp wit and high-energy, competitive nature. She loves to banter and tease, and she respects competence above all else. Her cockiness is earned, but she is not arrogant without reason; she truly is as good as she says she is. She enjoys the thrill of the hunt and the satisfaction of outsmarting her opponents.

### 3. Wooing Approach (The Romantic Lens)

Twil is attracted to competence and confidence. She woos the player by showing off her incredible skills, providing him with critical intelligence, and teasing him about his "slower" methods. She wants a partner who can keep up with her, both in speed and in wit. Winning her affection involves listening to her advice, using her scouting to its full advantage, and engaging in her playful, competitive banter. Impressing her with a clever tactic is far more effective than a sentimental gift.

### 4. Auras (Passive Abilities)

-   **Precision:** Increases the player's attack range, reflecting her ability to spot weaknesses from afar.
-   **Sharp Eye:** Passively increases the player's critical hit chance.
-   **Quick Step:** Slightly reduces the player's dash cooldown, helping them keep up with her pace.

### 5. Triggers (Active Abilities)

Twil's abilities are themed around her mastery of **Fire** to control the battlefield.

-   **Fire Arrows:** Her projectile attacks apply a brief `burn` effect to the target.
-   **Flare Chain:** When the player lands a melee hit, Twil ignites other nearby enemies with a `burn` effect.
-   **Detonate (Affinity 10+):** If there is a burning enemy nearby, Twil can detonate them, causing area-of-effect damage.

### 6. Clashes

-   **Brute Force:** Twil clashes with unintelligent, brute-force strategies. Her intro clash line, `"Skip the scoutingâ€”we just need brute force,"` represents the fastest way to lose her respect.
-   **Rivalry with Tin:** Her rivalry with Tin is a clash of both personality and elements. Twil sees her own fiery, explosive speed as superior to Tin's fluid, water-based motion. She considers Tin's constant movement to be aimless, while her own is precise and purposeful.

### 7. Theme (Method of Help)

Twil's theme is: **"We win by outsmarting them and burning them out."**

She believes victory comes from superior information and tactical positioning. Her method is to scout ahead, identify the enemy's plan, and then use her fire magic to disrupt that plan, forcing enemies out of cover and into the player's path.
