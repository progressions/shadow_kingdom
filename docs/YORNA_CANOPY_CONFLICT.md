# Yorna and Canopy: Level 2 Conflict

This document outlines the narrative sequence for the mandatory conflict scene between Yorna and Canopy at the start of Level 2.

## 1. Overview

This scene serves as a critical character moment that externalizes the ongoing friction between Yorna and Canopy. It forces the player to make a meaningful choice that reflects their own preferred strategy and values, by siding with either Yorna's aggressive, results-driven approach or Canopy's cautious, protective one.

This decision has immediate gameplay consequences, as the unchosen companion will leave the party.

## 2. Trigger

This event triggers automatically when the player enters Level 2 with both Yorna and Canopy in the active party. It should be presented as a visual novel (VN) style interaction.

## 3. Scene Script

The scene opens with narrative text establishing the context before moving to dialogue. The tone is direct and grounded, per the `NARRATIVE_TONE_GUIDE.md`.

**(Narrative Text)**

> The tension between Yorna and Canopy has been building for miles. Every decision has become a quiet struggle. Yorna pushes the pace, her frustration clear in her clipped movements. Canopy urges caution, her disapproval shown in steady, deliberate slowness.
>
> Now, they have stopped. The argument is no longer quiet.

**(Dialogue)**

> **Yorna:** Chief, she is too slow. If we wait, we will be surrounded. We must attack now. You have to choose.
>
> **Canopy:** My Lord, to attack without knowing what is there is a mistake. We will lose people. I cannot support a plan that is so careless.

## 4. Player Choice and Consequence

The player is presented with a choice to side with either Yorna or Canopy.

*   **If the player sides with Yorna:** Canopy will leave the party.

The unchosen companion will refuse to join the party as long as their rival is present. This state persists until a later event or quest allows the player to broker a truce between them.
