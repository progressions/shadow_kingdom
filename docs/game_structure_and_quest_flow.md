# Game Structure and Quest Flow

This document outlines the high-level structure for the mid-game, focusing on the companion quest system and the transition to the game's final act.

## 1. The Mid-Game Structure: A Race for Keys

The mid-game is defined by a "Hub and Spoke" model. The Heart of the Temple serves as the central hub, where the player interacts with companions and prepares for adventures.

- **The Quest Pool:** The companions offer a large pool of potential adventures (approximately 30 quests, assuming 10 companions with 3 adventures each).
- **The Quest Budget:** The player has a limited "budget" of **12** companion adventures they can complete per playthrough.

This structure forces the player to make meaningful strategic choices. They cannot acquire every "key" to defeating Urathar, so they must prioritize which companions to build relationships with and which strategic advantages to pursue.

## 2. Triggering the Final Phase

The final phase of the game begins immediately upon the completion of the **12th** companion adventure.

- **Lockout:** All other companion quests become unavailable for the remainder of the playthrough.
- **Narrative Shift:** The main story focus shifts away from the companions and toward the final confrontation. Queen Rose and Kael the All-Priest become the primary quest-givers, initiating the endgame sequence which culminates in the assault on Urathar's fortress.

This hard limit ensures that each playthrough is unique and enhances replayability, as players will want to explore the adventures and outcomes they missed.

## 3. Companion-Gated Exploration

To deepen strategic choices and make party composition more meaningful outside of combat, certain adventure levels will require specific companion abilities to fully navigate.

A companion's utility is not just in their combat prowess, but in their ability to unlock paths through the world.

### Example A: Environmental Traversal

- **Companion:** Tin
- **Ability:** At a sufficient affinity level, Tin can use her speed to create a temporary path across water surfaces, allowing the party to cross lakes or rivers.
- **Application:** An adventure designed for Tin could feature critical objectives or valuable treasures on islands in a lake, making her presence in the party a necessity for 100% completion.

### Example B: Hazard Immunity

- **Companion:** Twil
- **Ability:** At high affinity, Twil's mastery of her environment allows her to grant the party temporary immunity to extreme heat and fire.
- **Application:** An adventure like Yorna's quest in the **Volcanic Heartforge** would be filled with lava flows that block paths and cause severe damage. Bringing a high-affinity Twil would be the intended, strategic solution to navigate the level safely, creating a powerful cross-companion synergy.
